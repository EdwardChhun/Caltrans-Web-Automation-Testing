D08,I-15 and I-40 TPAS,"This project will address truck parking availability by expanding the network of dynamic signage currently proposed for the I-10 Corridor Coalition TPAS multi-state project, expected to launch in 2023. Additionally, this project will enhance safety and include smart features such as lighting, wifi, and connected vehicle technology. 
Advanced information about truck parking availability will enhance safety of truck drivers and motoring public overall, will improve compliance of truck drivers with the required rest breaks, minimize the truck parking on the highway shoulders and illegal use of shoulders.
The Truck Parking Availability System (TPAS) will monitor truck parking availability at Safety Roadside Rest Areas (SRRA) in District 8 and provide real-time information to truck drivers. TPAS will be deployed at eight sites along I-15 & I-40 in San Bernardino County. The scope of work includes infrastructure improvements in addition to hardware and software installation at CV Kane (I-15 NB/SB), Valley Wells (I-15 NB/SB), Desert Oasis (I-40 EB/WB), and John Wilkie (I-40 EB/WB). Additionally, there is a possibility of an additional 9th site at a future proposed Cajon Pass Truck Parking Facility.

D11,Calexico East Land Port of Entry Joint Operations System,"To reduce traffic congestion for commercial and passenger vehicles at the border
In alignment with the USDOT Departmental and Program Priorities, the implementation of a joint operation system will address safety and reliability, resiliency, equity and access, climate, partnerships, and integration priorities to provide significant regional and international benefits. The project increases economic competitiveness by creating reliability for cross-border commercial vehicles through appointment windows at the POE; this will ensure that freight companies can meet additional appointments at seaports, warehouses, and other freight gateways, thereby saving binational companies time and money by reducing a current supply
chain bottleneck. Additionally, the project will provide more equitable travel solutions to nearby binational communities through lessening congestion and air pollution by reducing wait times at California-Baja California POEs; this will be accomplished through a traveler information system displaying real-time border wait times and a commercial vehicle appointment system. The project’s microwave communication connection will close a current communication gap in a rural area in California; binational safety and resiliency will be enhanced by having faster incident response times between binational agencies, allowing for more efficient incident closures. Binational relationships/partnerships will strengthen by establishing data-sharing protocols between federal, state, and local stakeholders. Overall, the integration of a joint operation system will improve the connectivity of the traveling public utilizing POEs.
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the Imperial County Transportation Commission (ICTC) propose developing a joint operations system for the Calexico East Port of Entry (POE), which will also debut the first land POE appointment system for commercial vehicles and potentially passenger vehicles. Using current border conditions, the system will allow commercial vehicle border users to pay for a designated appointment window to cross the border. This first-in-the-nation application will be piloted initially for commercial vehicles and could be expanded to passenger vehicles. If successful, this pilot has the potential to be scalable by expanding to the other POEs along the California-Baja California border, including the new Otay Mesa East POE, and could be utilized at other POEs along the northern and southern borders in the United States. This system will expand upon appointment systems that are currently being used at the nation’s seaports and introduce proven technologies to land POEs.


In Stage 1, Caltrans and the ICTC will develop a Concept of Operations (ConOps) to identify the operational characteristics for the joint operations system. Caltrans, ICTC, and their stakeholders will contribute to the development of the ConOps to determine the technologies that will be implemented. The ConOps will reference the design standards that will be used for the system and how different scenarios will be addressed. To explore the technologies needed for the system, Caltrans will look at each piece of information that the system intends to output and design a program for that purpose. The programming for both the truck appointment system and
messaging system will require communication between Caltrans and CBP.

For the potential Stage 2 grant, the selected prototype will be scaled-up to be integrated with the existing transportation system and real-life circumstances. The desired outcome for Stage 2 is for many commercial vehicles and possibly passenger vehicles to utilize the appointment system. By allotting commercial vehicles to specified appointment windows, the demand at border crossings will be spread throughout the day and prevent long wait times and bottlenecks. Allowing vehicles to potentially use a dedicated lane at the border will incentivize vehicles to make appointments. As a result, neighboring roads, highways, and residential areas will be less
congested and experience improvements in air quality. If the system is successful, it can be implemented to other land POEs and increase efficiency across the border.",Calexico East Land Port Entry,Proposed,Christina Ngo,Travel Demand Management

D11,Integrating the Wrong Way Detection System into C-V2X Environment,"Deploy RSUs at critical points along a 3.2 1.2 mile segment of State Highway. Decentralize the communication between the wrong way detection system and the vehicle to infrastructure system. Deploy edge computing in an existing communication hub to reduce data and notification latency.
The early warning of impending collision from the wrong way vehicle allows right way vehicles to exit the highway, take evasive maneuvers or pull over until the danger passes.
Safety on the roadway is a top priority. In a connected environment, both the right way driver and wrong way driver are notified of the impending danger. Saving every life even the wrong way driver is the goal. The efficiency of the highway improves, the sooner the danger is removed from the roadway.
Wrong way collision is a nationwide problem. The success in California through the connected environment is a demonstration of ""safety through connectivity"". If California can demonstrate a high success rate in eliminating wrong way collision, other DOTs across the nation will adapt to a connected environment.",,Proposed,Louie   La Compte,Wrong Way Detection
D11,Imperial County ITS Implementation,"This proposal supports the US DOT’s vision and program goals through the deployment of ITS elements along state routes in Imperial County. This area experiences both extreme heat and flash floods and currently lacks the infrastructure to support its already disadvantaged community. Critical improvements and disaster prevention are possible through the installation of fixed Changeable Message Signs (CMSs), Roadway Weather Information Stations (RWISs), Closed-Circuit Televisions (CCTVs), and V2X Road-side Units (RSUs) in this area.
This program will improve system safety and address disparities in transportation equity (and the safety of vulnerable road users): The majority of Imperial County falls under the disadvantaged community criteria and also has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, along with high unemployment rates. In addition, Imperial County is the only county in California expected to experience more than 100 days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in 2023. This, along with recurring flash floods, high winds, and wildfires, can severely impair the community and strain local resources. By deploying the proposed ITS elements, Caltrans can alert travelers at key decision points as well as better locate and resolve incidents along the state right-of-way, improving safety, reliability, traveler mobility, equity, efficiency, and interconnectivity.
The impact will be evaluated through various transportation system performance measures such as enhanced system accessibility, reliability, resiliency, reduced congestion, travel times, traffic incidents, and incident clearance times.
The formidable landscape, harsh climate, and limited existing infrastructure in Imperial County are only a few reasons why this project is paramount in demonstrating the reach and impact of using the 5.9 GHz ITS licensed spectrum and other wireless communications. Traditional communication methods can be prohibitive to disadvantaged communities due to being labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, this proposal aims to illustrate that the convenience and flexibility of wireless communication between ITS elements in rural communities and regional Transportation Management Centers (TMCs) is not only possible but essential to achieving a truly interoperable nationwide transportation system.",,Proposed,Rafael Reyes,Freeway Management
D11,San Vicente Corridor ITS Deployments,"The San Vicente Corridor provides critical access and connectivity for rural communities along SR 67. The Corridor connects the unincorporated communities of Ramona and Lakeside to the City of Poway and other portions of the County of San Diego and provides access to the tribal lands of the Barona Band of Mission Indians, Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel, and the Mesa Grande Band of Mission Indians. The deployment of V2X ITS equipment within the Ramona community could substantially reduce the potential for fatalities and crippling economic losses during an emergency. This proposal suggests installing V2X devices to work in tandem with other ITS assets like dynamic message signs (DMS) and closed-circuit televisions (CCTV) to increase traffic flow by more efficiently distributing information between emergency operations centers like the Caltrans Transportation Management Center (TMC) and vulnerable road users in the region during an evacuation. 
This program will enhance traveler mobility, mitigate environmental impacts, and improve the efficiency of movement by facilitating better communication between travelers and regional Transportation Management Centers (TMCs). The common features of corridor and its parallel and connecting roadways encompassing the Ramona community are steep grades, curves, and large intersections. The corridor is a lifeline between rural and urbanized San Diego, but with few alternative transportation mode choices, frequent congestion leads to increased carbon emissions and economic losses for goods movement. During previous wildfire events, the lack of timely information dissemination was noted as a major cause of evacuation delays. With V2X infrastructure, coordination between essential organizations and the public is automated and adaptive, accelerating disaster response and resolution.
Performance measures such as system reliability, resiliency, reduced congestion, travel times, traffic incidents, and incident clearance times will be utilized to evaluate the system’s impact and efficacy. Comparisons to previous years will aid in determining the program’s fiscal and environmental impact.
By using devices connected to the 5.9 GHz ITS licensed spectrum and other wireless communication systems, this proposal can act as a case study validating the importance of these systems during emergency evacuations along challenging corridors between rural and urban communities.",,Proposed,Rafael Reyes,Freeway Management

D11,Adaptive ramp metering,"Identify the need to alleviate bottle necks along a selected segment of any freeway by means of connecting/having ramp meters communicate with each other through a central server system to adjust metering rates linearly and in real time. The idea would be to incrementally adjust multiple metering stations upstream of the congested station having the bottle neck downstream, not just adjacent meters. Also, look at ways to accommodate multiple bottle necks within a segment.
We will attempt to incorporate the system in the new Caltrans statewide central system (CATMS), or its' interim solution. The interim solution is currently being deployed to various districts, this is the opportunity to include this task.
Benefits are public safety, less incidents on freeways, improved traffic flow, improved fuel savings, cost saving, automation and resource/personnel time savings, less travel delay leading to a positive economic impact.",,Proposed,Saiid Noroozi,Ramp meters
