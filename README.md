This is the website that I eventually want to access to upload and populate the website with current pilot projects (66)

Further on the portal will be the source of populating the projects itself, will no longer be needing this code base to automate for us.

Solutions is to run locally, this was initially on a github codespace env, issues such as authentication arises.
No GUi due to running cloud-base, difficult to navigate complex dynamic site.

Solutions <br></br>
1. Run Locally
2. Access the website and run authentication
3. Move pilot projects file onto local computer
